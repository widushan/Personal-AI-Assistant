**"Lost in the Haze"**

(Verse 1)
In the silence, I hear your voice
Whispers of memories, a haunting choice
To hold on to what we had found
Or let go, and watch it drown

(Chorus)
We're lost in the haze, of a love that's gone
Fading like the sun, our hearts are moving on
We said forever, but forever's come and gone
Now I'm left to pick up the pieces, and move along

(Verse 2)
I remember the nights, we'd dance under the stars
Our love was a flame, that burned near and far
But like a wildfire, it burned out of control
Leaving only ashes, and a heart that's cold

(Chorus)
We're lost in the haze, of a love that's gone
Fading like the sun, our hearts are moving on
We said forever, but forever's come and gone
Now I'm left to pick up the pieces, and move along

(Bridge)
I'll learn to let go, to release the pain
To find my way, through the heartache and the rain
I'll rise up from the ashes, like a phoenix born
And I'll find my way, to a brand new dawn

(Chorus)
We're lost in the haze, of a love that's gone
Fading like the sun, our hearts are moving on
We said forever, but forever's come and gone
Now I'm left to pick up the pieces, and move along

(Outro)
In the silence, I'll find my way
Through the darkness, I'll rise up to a brand new day
And though it's hard, I'll learn to let go
Of the love we had, and the heartache that it showed.
