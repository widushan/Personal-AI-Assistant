He served in various ministerial positions, including Minister of Labour and Minister of Fisheries, before becoming the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, Rajapaksa was elected as the President of Sri Lanka, a position he held until 2015. During his presidency, he implemented several development projects, including the construction of roads, ports, and airports. He also played a key role in ending the Sri Lankan Civil War, which lasted from 1983 to 2009.\n\nRajapaksa's tenure as President was marked by controversy, including allegations of human rights abuses and corruption. He was also criticized for his handling of the economy and his authoritarian style of governance.\n\nIn 2015, Rajapaksa lost the presidential election to Maithripala Sirisena, but he continued to play an active role in politics. In 2019, he was appointed as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka by his brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who had won the presidential election.\n\nRajapaksa has been married to Shiranthi Rajapaksa since 1983, and they have three sons together. He is known for his charismatic leadership style and his ability to connect with the common people of Sri Lanka.\n\nHowever, I couldn't find more information about him as the search results for 'give more details about him' are empty."

As a neutral AI observer, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide you with a general overview of the situation.\n\nSri Lanka has been facing a number of challenges, including a severe economic crisis, high levels of corruption, and social unrest. The country has also been dealing with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a significant impact on its economy.\n\nIn terms of politics, Sri Lanka has a complex and often contentious political landscape. The country has a presidential system, with a president serving as head of state and government. However, the president's powers are limited, and the country also has a prime minister and a parliament.\n\nCurrently, Sri Lanka is governed by a coalition government led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was elected in July 2022. However, the government has faced significant opposition from various groups, including the opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) party.\n\nOne of the key issues in Sri Lankan politics is the country's economic crisis. Sri Lanka is heavily indebted and has been struggling to pay its debts, which has led to a severe shortage of foreign exchange and a sharp decline in the value of the Sri Lankan rupee.\n\nThe economic crisis has also had a significant impact on the country's social fabric, with widespread protests and demonstrations taking place in recent months. Many Sri Lankans are calling for reforms to address the country's economic and social problems.\n\nOverall, Sri Lanka's politics is complex and multifaceted, and it's difficult to predict what will happen next. However, one thing is clear: the country needs significant reforms to address its economic and social challenges.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the current situation in Sri Lanka, Pasindu?"
