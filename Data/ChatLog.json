Rajapaksa studied at Richmond College in Galle and later at the University of Ceylon, where he earned a degree in law.\n\nRajapaksa's entry into politics began in 1970 when he was elected as a member of the Sri Lankan Parliament. He served in various ministerial positions, including Minister of Labour and Minister of Fisheries, before becoming the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, Rajapaksa was elected as the President of Sri Lanka, a position he held until 2015. During his presidency, he implemented several development projects, including the construction of roads, ports, and airports. He also played a key role in ending the Sri Lankan Civil War, which lasted from 1983 to 2009.\n\nRajapaksa's tenure as President was marked by controversy, including allegations of human rights abuses and corruption. He was also criticized for his handling of the economy and his authoritarian style of governance.\n\nIn 2015, Rajapaksa lost the presidential election to Maithripala Sirisena, but he continued to play an active role in politics. In 2019, he was appointed as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka by his brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who had won the presidential election.\n\nRajapaksa has been married to Shiranthi Rajapaksa since 1983, and they have three sons together. He is known for his charismatic leadership style and his ability to connect with the common people of Sri Lanka.\n\nHowever, I couldn't find more information about him as the search results for 'give more details about him' are empty."
